# color-calendar

Hello! It this challenge, we color-coded a time schedule sheet and made the past, present, and future different colors to represent the current time. We also needed to be able to save to-do items in the time slots.

I worked with my tutor Robert Kurle on this assignment, all lines were a result of our tutoring session.
